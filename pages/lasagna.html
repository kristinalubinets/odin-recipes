        <blockquote><p>Italian favorite of lasagne or lasagna that we all know and love originated in Italy in the city of 
            Naples during the Middle Ages. One of the first references to modern-day lasagne can be found in a 14th-century 
            English cookbook that highlighted a dish with layers of pasta without the tomatoes. Later, another reference was 
            made to lasagne in an Italian cookbook in the 1880s that featured tomato sauce. 
            <br>
            <br>
            The dish eventually evolved into the traditional lasagna of Naples called “Lasagna di Carnevale” made with local sausage, 
            fried meatballs, hard-boiled eggs, ricotta or mozzarella, and Neapolitan Ragu. One of the most popular variations of this 
            lasagna dish is called “Lasagna al Forno.” This variation originates from the Italian region of Emilia-Romagna and is made 
            with ricotta or mozzarella, thick Ragu, bechamel sauce, wine, onion, oregano, and green sheets of pasta made with spinach. 
            Lasagne’s history wouldn’t be complete without variety throughout the regions of Italy. Different areas may use different 
            dough or sauces. The beautiful Italian region of Piedmont specializes in lasagna al Sangue, which translates to “bloody lasagne” 
            due to the addition of blood from a slaughtered pig.</p></blockquote>
